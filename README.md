**Warning!** _It looks like the script does not work anymore (tested on v.190-192). See https://github.com/kov4l3nko/InstagramSSLPinningBypass-iOS/issues/5 for details._

**Warning!** _[Numenorean](https://github.com/Numenorean) reported a problem with Instagram app of version 176. However, it looks like the script works ok with the next app version, Instagram 177. See https://github.com/kov4l3nko/InstagramSSLPinningBypass-iOS/issues/2#issue-818636113 for details._

See [FAQ](docu/README.md) for details.

**Warning!** If something does not work, try to fix it yourself or just forget about it. I take a look at this GitHub account from time to time ( ==once a year) and support the script in my spare time ( ==never), so the pain you feel while using the script is  100% yours.
