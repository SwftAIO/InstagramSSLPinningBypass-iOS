# A Frida script to bypass SSL pinning in Instagram (iOS)

UPD: It looks like the protection has been improved. Unfortunately, I have no time to research/bypass it right now because of high workload on my main work :( I'll try to research it soon (but can't say for sure how soon). See https://github.com/kov4l3nko/InstagramSSLPinningBypass-iOS/issues/2#issue-818636113 for details.

See [FAQ](docu/README.md) for details.

**Warning!** If something does not work, try to fix it yourself or just forget about it. I take a look at this GitHub account from time to time ( ==once a year) and support the script in my spare time ( ==never), so the pain you feel while using the script is  100% yours.
